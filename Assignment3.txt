      a) 

	SELECT * 

	FROM habit
	
WHERE frequency_id = 1

	This filters out all the frequencies, which id's are not equal to 1.


      b) 

	SELECT habit.*

	FROM habit, habit_list
	
WHERE isPublic = 1

	The 'isPublic' field in habit_list uses a logical notation (0/1) for true and false. We use this query to show all habits which are part of a public list.

	SELECT habit.*

	FROM habit_done, habit
	
WHERE timestamp between '2017-10-03 00:20:39' AND '2017-10-17 20:34:04'

	This is a query designed to show all habits which are completed between 2017-10-03 00:20:39 and 2017-10-17 20:34:04
