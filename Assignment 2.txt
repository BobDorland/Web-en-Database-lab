LAB ASSIGNMENT 2 WEB AND DATABASE

1) Overview of actions plan: 

* Add a habit with a desired frequency
  
   - Control: a button ("Add habit")
   - Event: click a button
   - Event occurs: The user should be able to select certain days, on which this habit will be planned. And the title of this habit (all in a pop-up), also whether it's a good or bad habit
  
* Delete a habit

   - Control: a button ("Delete habit")
   - Event: click a button
   - Event occurs: The user will get a list of all his current habits in a pop-up. Here the user can select which habits to delete and finally actually delete them. 

* Update the status of a habit at a particular time (CSS for this also)

   - Control: The habit calendar in the habit tracker app page (a day)
   - Event: click on a certain day
   - Event occurs: When the user marks a habit as done, it will turn into a green or red color. (positive/negative). When done again, the field becomes white again.

* Change an existing habit's content

   - Control: the habit calendar
   - Event: click on the habit name
   - Event occurs: User will get a pop-up screen where he or she can edit the title, the days on which this habit will be planned. Also change the fact whether it's a good or bad habit.

* Sort the habits according to how well they are meeting the desired goals (SQL for this => order by / group by)

    - Control: three different buttons
    - Event: User clicks one of the three buttons
    - Event occurs: The order of the habits changes, according to the chosen options. When one is chosen, positive habits which are done the most and negative habits which are done the least, get moved up. When two is chosen, the positive habits done the least and negative habits done the most get moved up. When three is chosen, the oldest habits get moved up.

* Addition of comments to habits (extra)

    - Control: A field in the calendar with habits 
    - Event: User clicks on a field
    - Event occurs: When the user clicks a field, he or she can add a comment to that field. It will be displayed after.


2) Object-orientated programming:


We will add the following classes, we use the basic constructor design pattern:

* Habit - class (with title, days)
* PositiveHabit - extends Habit (tile, days) 
* NegativeHabit - extends Habit (title, days)  
* HabitList (Array with all habits)
* Comment (String, date, habit)
* CommentList (array with comments) 
* User (User name, HabitList, CommentList)

We think inheritance would be good to apply on the Habit class, because positive and negative habits share many attributes, but they are treated seperately sometimes. Most things are in classes, because some data has to be fetched often and it's very inconvenient to write SQL queries for each of these fetches.


3) Writing Code

See our JavaScript files.


4) Start my SQL server

We have tried to execute MySQL.


5) Connect to SQL server via command line

Enter password: *********

mysql> HELP SHOW DATABASES
Name: 'SHOW DATABASES'
Description:
Syntax:
SHOW {DATABASES | SCHEMAS}
    [LIKE 'pattern' | WHERE expr]

SHOW DATABASES lists the databases on the MySQL server host. SHOW
SCHEMAS is a synonym for SHOW DATABASES. The LIKE clause, if present,
indicates which database names to match. The WHERE clause can be given
to select rows using more general conditions, as discussed in
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/extended-show.html.

You see only those databases for which you have some kind of privilege,
unless you have the global SHOW DATABASES privilege. You can also get
this list using the mysqlshow command.

If the server was started with the --skip-show-database option, you
cannot use this statement at all unless you have the SHOW DATABASES
privilege.
