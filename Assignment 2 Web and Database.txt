1) Overview of actions plan: 

* Add a habit with a desired frequency
  
   - Control: a button ("Add habit")
   - Event: click a button
   - Event occurs: The user should be able to select certain dates, on which this habit will be planned. And the title of this habit (all in a pop-up), also whether it's a good or bad habit
  
* Delete a habit

   - Control: a button ("Delete habit")
   - Event: click a button
   - Event occurs: The user will get a list of all his current habits in a pop-up. Here the user can select which habits to delete and finally actually delete them. Also the user has to confirm his/her choise.

* Update the status of a habit at a particular time

   - Control: The habit calendar in the habit tracker app page (a field)
   - Event: click on a certain habit (select a field)
   - Event occurs: When the users clicks on this field, the field will turn green or red, indicated it has been completed (green for positive habits, red for negative ones.) If the field was already marked as completed and the user presses it again, it will turn white again, marking it as uncompleted

* Change an existing habit's content

   - Control: The habit's name on the left of the days of the week. (little pencil icon) 
   - Event: click on this little pencil icon
   - Event occurs: User will get a pop-up screen where he or she can edit the title, the days on which this habit will be planned. Also change the fact whether it's a good or bad habit.

* Sort the habits according to how well they are meeting the desired goals

    - Control: A drop down menu (different sorting options; Best performance on top (1), Worst performance on top (2), Date of addition(3))
    - Event: User chooses one of the three options
    - Event occurs: The order of the habits changes, according to the chosen options. When one is chosen, positive habits which are done the most and negative habits which are done the least, get moved up. When two is chosen, the positive habits done the least and negative habits done the most get moved up. When three is chosen, the oldes habits get moved up.

* Addition of comments to habits (extra)

    - Control: A field in the calendar with habits (A text bubble, which appears when the user hovers over this)
    - Event: User hovers over this certain field with the mouse and clicks it or not (depending whether the user wants to add comments or not)
    - Event occurs: When the user hovers over the field, he can see added comments to this habit. When this happens, a little text bubble icon will appear, when this icon is clicked, a pop-up appears, where the user can add comments.


2) Object-orientated programming:


We are planning to add a few classes, these are the following: 

* Habit - abstract class (with title, days)
* PositiveHabit - extends Habit (tile, days) 
* NegativeHabit - extends Habit (title, days)  
* HabitList (Array with all habits)
* Comment (String, date, habit)
* CommentList (array with comments) 
* User (User name, HabitList, CommentList)

These are classes which we are planning to make. We think inheritance would be good to apply on the Habit class, because they share many comments, but they treated seperately sometimes. Most things are in classes, because some data has to be fetched often and it's very inconvenient to write SQL queries for each of these fetches.
